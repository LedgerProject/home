# The BackMe Project

Backme is a new way for content creators to build their own community and earn money based on human-centric values. With Backme content creators can receive small
recurring donations, collaborate with other content creators and explore new business2business opportunities. This in respect of the privacy of their individual
fans and in way that is ethical and sustainable. What we try to achieve with Backme is that there can be an internet without the need for advertising revenue’s or paywall's. 
We started exploring the possibilities of a revenue model without advertisements and paywalls back in 2017. In 2018 we dedicated ourselves to desk- and market research, experiments and eventually pilots. As of January 1st we incorporated Backme and we have achieved an constant average growth M2M of 20% with almost no need for marketing. We hope to expand beyond the Netherlands to other countries in Europe where freedom of press and freedom of expression is more limited than the Netherlands and help dissident bloggers, journalists and vloggers keep standing up for minorities and share their stories and content. eventually pilots.
