### Distributed Secure Smart Farming Log (DISEMIN)
Ex Machina is an IoT system integrator that serves industrial customers with environmental monitoring & predictive analytics solutions, using machine learning and modular hardware.
Like most Greeks, we have farmers in our family and we see that the farming digital transformation promise is derailing.  We see farmers losing control over their farming practices, becoming alienated from their work and having to adjust to technology and large corporations rather than the other way round.
We decided to enter the agricultural space, with our open IoT solutions and the goal to create a marketplace where farmers and advisors can share data and services in a fair manner.
