[LEDGER](https://ledgerproject.eu/) - DecentraLizEd Data Governance for nExt geneRation internet -  had an ambitious vision to shift data management, stimulating and developing the conditions for the birth of economic, regulatory, and technical alternative models that preserve citizens digital sovereignty, where data is a common good owned by citizens and wealth created by data-driven platforms is equally distributed.

To do so, its main goal was to support Human-centric Innovators - SMEs, start-ups and Researchers- taking research contributions and technologies from the [DECODE framework](https://decodeproject.eu/), to develop Minimum Viable Products and services linked to relevant Vertical Use Cases addressing data sovereignty, privacy-by-design, decentralised data governance, reliability, trustworthiness and openness as core values. 

This space is an effort to keep alive and in contact the Ledger open-source developers' community also beyond the duration of the program and to provide a standard technical presentation and links to the open source repositories, that we believe can benefit the entire open source community, and by so contribute to the collective progress towards new economic and social models.
